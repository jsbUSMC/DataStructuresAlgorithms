# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a copy of the source code used in the book <span style="text-decoration: underlined;">Algorithms, 4th Edition</span> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
This is NOT the official version&mdash;it isn't actively maintained and updated by the authors.

The repository for this code is located [on GitHub](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4) as well. This repository is
 meant for personal use by myself and my friends.
